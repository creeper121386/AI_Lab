## 1.Short Introduction

Niccolò Paganini(27 October 1782 – 27 May 1840) was an famous Italian violinist, violist, guitarist, and composer. He was the most famous and skilled violinist of his time, and left his mark as one of the pillars of modern violin technique. His 24 Caprices for Solo Violin Op. 1 are among the best known of his compositions, and have served as an inspiration for many prominent composers after his death, and He also developed many playing skills of violin.

## 2.Personal Experience

Niccolò Paganini was born in Genoa, Italy, Oct 27, 1782. and he was one of six children in his family. He was an Italian violinist and a composer, considered by many people as the greatest one of all time. He received some music lessons from his father before he was 6 years old and later  on he learned from the best instructors in Genoa. In 1795 he went to Parma, Italy to study, but his skills was even better than the teachers. So He then commenced on a course of self-training. In 1809 he became a soloist performing his own music throughout the whole Italy.

Because of his playing skills, His playing of violin was so beautiful that his audiences often burst into tears, and yet, he could perform with such force and velocity that at Vienna one listener became half crazed and declared that for some days that he had seen the Devil helping the violinist Paganini. So that is why Paganini was also called "devil of violin" by people later on.

For the next years, he started traveling all over the Europe. And during that time Paganini began to attract the attention of other prominent, though more conservative, musicians across Europe. In 1827, Pope Leo XII honoured Paganini with the Order of the Golden Spur. In that time, his fame spread across Europe.

After his fame was established, Paganini’s life was a mixture of triumphs and personal excesses. He earned large sums of money but he indulged recklessly in gambling and other forms of dissipation. And he was also no stranger to chronic illnesses. He was diagnosed with syphilis as early as 1822, and his remedy, which included mercury and opium, came with serious physical and psychological side effects.

In September 1834, Paganini put an end to his concert career and returned to Genoa. Contrary to popular beliefs involving his wishing to keep his music and techniques secret, Paganini devoted his time to the publication of his compositions and violin methods. He accepted students, of whom two enjoyed moderate success: violinist Camillo Sivori and cellist Gaetano Ciandelli. In 1836, Paganini returned to Paris to set up a casino. Its immediate failure left him in financial ruin, and he auctioned off his personal effects, including his musical instruments, to recoup his losses. At Christmas of 1838, he left Paris for Marseilles and, after a brief stay, he traveled to Nice where his condition worsened.

In May 1840, the Bishop of Nice sent Paganini a local parish priest to perform the last rites. Paganini assumed the sacrament was premature, and refused. On 27 May 1840, Paganini died from internal hemorrhaging before a priest could be summoned. Because of this, and his widely rumored association with the devil, the Church denied his body a Catholic burial in Genoa. It took four years and an appeal to the Pope before the Church let his body be transported to Genoa, but it was still not buried. His body was finally buried in 1876, in a cemetery in Parma. 

## 3.Compositions

Paganini’s genius as a player overshadows his work as a composer. In fact, he also had the great talent as a composer. He wrote much of his music for his own performances, these music were so difficult that it was commonly thought that he entered into a pack with the Devil. His compositions included 24 caprices (published in 1820) for unaccompanied violin that are among the most difficult works ever written for the instrument. He also challenged musicians with such compositions as his 12 sonatas for violin and guitar. And he also composed 6 violin concerti; and 6 quartets for violin, viola, cello, and guitar.

His 24 Caprices were likely composed in the period between 1805 and 1809, while he was in the service of the Baciocchi court. Also during this period, he composed the majority of the solo pieces, duo-sonatas, trios and quartets for the guitar, either as a solo instrument or with strings. 

Generally speaking, Paganini's compositions were technically imaginative, and the timbre of the instrument was greatly expanded as a result of these works. Sounds of different musical instruments and animals were often imitated. One such composition was titled Fandango Spanolo (The Spanish Dance), which featured a series of humorous imitations of farm animals. Even more outrageous was a solo piece Duetto Amoroso, in which the sighs and groans of lovers were intimately depicted on the violin. There survives a manuscript of the Duetto, which has been recorded. The existence of the Fandango is known only through concert posters.

However, his works were criticized for lacking characteristics of true polyphonism, as pointed out by Eugène Ysaÿe. Yehudi Menuhin, on the other hand, suggested that this might have been the result of his reliance on the guitar (in lieu of the piano) as an aid in composition. The orchestral parts for his concertos were often polite, unadventurous, and clearly supportive of the soloist. In this, his style is consistent with that of other Italian composers such as Paisiello, Rossini and Donizetti, who were influenced by the guitar-song milieu of Naples during this period.

Paganini was also the inspiration of many prominent composers. Both "La Campanella" and the A minor Caprice have been an object of interest for a number of composers. Franz Liszt, Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Boris Blacher, Andrew Lloyd Webber, George Rochberg and Witold Lutosławski, among others, wrote well-known variations on these themes.

And as a violinist, his skill was very excellent. The Israeli violinist Ivry Gitlis once referred to Paganini as a phenomenon rather than a development. Though some of the techniques frequently employed by Paganini were already present, most accomplished violinists of the time focused on intonation and bowing techniques. Arcangelo Corelli was considered a pioneer in transforming the violin from an ensemble instrument to a solo instrument.

In the meantime, the polyphonic capability of the violin was firmly established through the Sonatas and Partitas BWV 1001–1006 of Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750). Other notable violinists included Antonio Vivaldi (1678–1741) and Giuseppe Tartini (1692–1770), who were in their compositions, reflected the increasing technical and musical demands on the violinist. Although the role of the violin in music drastically changed through this period, progress in violin technique was steady but slow. Techniques requiring agility of the fingers and the bow were still considered unorthodox and discouraged by the established community of violinists.

Much of Paganini's playing and his violin composition was influenced by two violinists, Pietro Locatelli (1693–1746) and August Duranowski (Auguste Frédéric Durand) (1770–1834). During Paganini's study in Parma, he came across the 24 Caprices of Locatelli (entitled L'arte di nuova modulazione – Capricci enigmatici or The art of the new style – the enigmatic caprices). Published in the 1730s, they were shunned by the musical authorities for their technical innovations, and were forgotten by the musical community at large. Around the same time, Durand, a former student of Giovanni Battista Viotti (1755–1824), became a celebrated violinist. He was renowned for his use of harmonics and the left hand pizzicato in his performance. Paganini was impressed by Durand's innovations and showmanship, which later also became the hallmarks of the young violin virtuoso. Paganini was instrumental in the revival and popularization of these violin techniques, which are now incorporated into regular compositions.

## 4.Appreciation

Taking "24 caprice" for example, it came out when Paganini was less than 20 years old, and played an important role in his life creation. The work is full of young passion and graceful melody, which reflects the rich national style, the rich imagination of the composer and the exquisite technique of playing, so it is the "touchstone" of the modern violinist. The world knows that painting is the art of vision, music is the art of hearing, but Paganini's works are not only audible, but also visual.

If you have the opportunity to listen to the violinist to play Paganini's work, or the master's playing from the audiovisual material, you will be coordinated by the left and right hands of the performer, and the perfect combination of skill and strength.

The first caprice in the twenty-four caprice is a good example. The player's right hand floats up and down quickly and up and down between the E string and the G string. The bow becomes an extension of the performer's body, beating quickly and cleverly over the four strings, like the light and clever elves. and in the fifth Fantasia, the performer's left hand is like the flying fire meteor, "shifting the shape" on the finger plate, as if a Wulin master, the speed, the strength and the accuracy are all stunning. What's more amazing is the left-hand play in the twenty-fourth caprice. The player's right hand has lost its traditional meaning. Left hand or press or dial, up and down, using only one hand to create the amazing effect.

The theme of the ninth consoles "The Hunt" is the flute and the round sign, and the flute and the horn are timbre, which is clever and powerful; the thirteenth "the devil's grim", the melodies and the rhythms are seems to be the same as Moussorgski's "the night of the barren hills"; And the fourteenth "March" has a strong rhythm, like a military parade with neat steps. Paganini used the chord to express this sense of pace, thus making the sound full of elasticity and tension; the twentieth "Pastoralle" melodic songs is full of rich folk customs, outline a school scenery which is elegant, quiet, distant.

The last caprice is the whole play, which is composed of 12 variations. It is not surprising that the piano master, Rachmaninoff, will be able to play it on the piano. In the first half of the twentieth Century, although there were many great violinist, such as Jascha Heifetz, Fritz Kreisler, and Milstein (Nathan Milstein), no one had ever publicly played Paganini's twenty-four Fantasia, and no one had recorded all of them until 70s. In the 70s, The generation of violinist, such as Salvatore Accardo, Ruggiero Ricci, ltzhak Perlman, Michael Robin, Mishima Li and so on, played the work completely.

## 5. My thoughts about Paganini

As for me, I have practiced playing violin for about one year, And during my experience of playing violin, I have known so many musicians and violinists, such as Tchaikovsky, Sarasate and so on. But among these famous musicians, who impressed me most is Paganini. For one reason, Paganini's music is very difficult for a violin beginner just like me. It is so difficult that I can't play any Paganini's work until now.  

But at the same time, after I knew the story of him, I can feel that Paganini is a lonely man. Although he is very famous in his age, this kind of loneliness is not the same as what Van Gogh had suffered from, which is from the ignorance of public. Paganini's loneliness is from his own heart. He was so talented that he was nearly mad at art and music. And maybe that is another reason he was called "devil". 

And after listening his music, I am completely attracted by his fantastic skills, especially the 24th caprice. His playing skill is so unique and difficult that until 1970s, there were no one can play the 24th caprice completely. I think He is well-deserved one of the best violinist in the history, and maybe, the last greatest violinist in the history.
